# Competitive Programming Helper

This is a simple C++ script to help you with Competitive Programming.

<br>

## Installation ðŸ”¨

You can build this program yourself or you can download the binary directly.

To set the template path create an environment variable `TEMPLATE_PATH` and set it to the path to your template.

For Linux users, add to this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` :

```bash
export TEMPLATE_PATH="/path/to/your/template"
```

<br>

## Usage ðŸ“„

```bash
[USAGE]: ch [CONTEST-NAME] [PROBLEM-COUNT]
   [OR]: ch [FILE-NAME]
```

The first method creates a directory named CONTEST-NAME in your current directory and creates PROBLEM-COUNT number of files with your template.

The second method creates a file named FILE-NAME in your current directory with your template.

*Note : Do not add extension to FILE-NAME, it automatically takes it from your template.*
